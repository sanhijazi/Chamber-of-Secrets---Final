          Represent the average COâ‚‚ emissions (g/km) of new passenger 
          cars per year. Until 2019, emissions were measured using the NEDC protocol, transitioning 
          to both NEDC and WLTP in 2020, and solely WLTP from 2021. The lollipop chart visualizes 
          trends and shifts in reported emissions over time.
